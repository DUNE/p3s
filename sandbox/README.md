# ATTENTION - THIS IS NOT P3S APPLICATION CODE

The code in this directory is not meant to be used in any
working application, it is (as the name suggests) a sandbox.

It is used to test the features (sometimes quite trivial)
of the packages and interfaces on which the application may
(or may not) depend. For example, this allows for quick checks
of new features in Python 3.
